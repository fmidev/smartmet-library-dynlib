# smartmet-library-dynlib — design notes

Written overnight 2026-04-17 → 2026-04-18 for morning review.

## Status at hand-off

### smartmet-library-dynlib (new repo, `~/hub/smartmet-library-dynlib/`)

- Compiles cleanly with `make`; 10 unit tests pass with `make test`.
- Staged locally at `$HOME/smartmet-dynlib-staging/` (lib64 + include/smartmet/dynlib).
- Vendored dynlib commit `cc4fc9e` (Clemens Spensberger, UiB, MIT) —
  only the Fortran files needed for detection, not the Python layer.
- Fortran is compiled with `gfortran -O2 -fPIC -fno-range-check`.
- `smartmet-library-dynlib.spec` lists `BuildRequires: gcc-gfortran,
  lapack-devel` and `Requires: blas, lapack, libgfortran` (updated after
  the user installed lapack-devel and noticed blas came with it).

### WMS plugin (`~/hub/brainstorm/plugins/wms/`)

- **New**: `GridFrontSource` — pulls scalar field + u/v from the
  querydata engine, calls `Fmi::Dynlib::detectFrontsMaxGrad`, returns
  `FrontCurve` curves in WGS84. Plugs into existing `WeatherFrontsLayer`
  via the new `"front_source": "grid"` option.
- **New**: `WeatherObjectsLayer` (`"layer_type": "weather_objects"`) —
  the single-layer design the user requested. Accepts an `objects`
  array where each entry selects one detector type. Supported:
  `fronts`, `fronts_maxcurv`, `jet_axes`, `trough_axes`,
  `convergence_lines`, `deformation_lines`, `vorticity_lines`.
- LayerFactory wires `weather_objects` as a new layer type.
- Makefile has a new `DYNLIB_STAGE` variable defaulting to
  `$HOME/smartmet-dynlib-staging`, with `-I`, `-L`, and `-Wl,-rpath`
  pointing there so the local build links without installing the RPM.
- My new files (`WeatherObjectsLayer.o`, `GridFrontSource.o`,
  `LayerFactory.o`, `WeatherFrontsLayer.o`) all compile cleanly.

### Not fixed

- A full `make wms.so` build fails in `Plugin.o` due to a *pre-existing*
  macgyver↔spine template version skew on the installed headers
  (`Fmi::Cache::Cache` expects different template parameters than
  `SmartMetCache.h` provides). This is unrelated to dynlib integration
  and was broken before I touched the repo. The user's local
  environment needs either an updated `smartmet-library-spine`
  install or a rebuild-and-install of the sibling repos in `~/hub`.
- Full WMS integration tests (in `test/input/*.get`) against live
  grid data were not added — they require running backends and a
  well-known producer. Unit tests for dynlib itself (10 passing)
  exercise the C → Fortran boundary, which is where the integration
  risk lives.

## Design choices I made without asking

1. **Vendor the Fortran, don't link upstream as RPM.** dynlib isn't
   packaged anywhere. Vendored as a subtree-style copy under
   `third_party/dynlib/` with upstream LICENSE preserved and a
   `UPSTREAM` file documenting the commit and refresh procedure.

2. **One C ABI per detector.** Alternatives considered: one generic
   `dynlib_detect(kind_enum, ...)` dispatch. I went with per-detector
   entry points (`dynlib_detect_fronts_maxgrad`, `_maxcurv`,
   `_jet_axes`, `_lines`, `_block_indicator`) because each has
   different inputs (scalar field vs wind-only) and different output
   shapes (three-type typed vs single-list vs scalar field).

3. **C++ API uses `Fmi::Matrix<double>`, not `NFmiDataMatrix<float>`.**
   The user flagged `NFmiDataMatrix` as a `vector<vector<>>` with bad
   cache locality and no contiguous pointer. `Fmi::Matrix<double>` is
   contiguous, `i` fastest, and its `&m(0,0)` pointer hands directly
   to the Fortran shim with no copy. The shim transposes internally
   because upstream dynlib declares fields as `(nz, ny, nx)` in
   Fortran column-major, which is `(x-slowest, y-fastest)` in C
   memory — the transpose of `Fmi::Matrix`.

4. **Shim always initialises outputs to NaN and resets module-level
   config on each call.** dynlib's Fortran subroutines declare
   outputs as `intent(out)`, and `line_locate` only writes the valid
   prefix — unused slots are uninitialised stack memory. The shim
   NaN-fills outputs and the C decoder stops at the first NaN /
   non-monotone offset. Config variables (`nsmooth`, `frint_thres`,
   `frspd_thres`) live at module scope in upstream; the shim resets
   them to the documented defaults on every call so a previous
   caller's override cannot leak into the next detection.

5. **Trough detection = vorticity lines.** dynlib does not ship a
   dedicated trough detector. Spensberger's group treats trough
   axes as maxima of cyclonic relative vorticity, so
   `detectTroughAxes` is an inline alias for `detectVorticityLines`.
   Flag for morning: if you want signed trough detection (sign the
   vorticity based on hemisphere), add it at the C++ layer — the
   Fortran `vorline` subroutine is already sign-agnostic.

6. **`WeatherObjectsLayer` is a new layer, not an extension of
   `WeatherFrontsLayer`.** The user's suggestion was "one layer
   listing all the objects". WeatherFrontsLayer has a mature SVG
   path + glyph rendering pipeline with typed styling for the six
   classical front/ridge/trough categories; mixing in jet axes and
   vorticity lines would have complicated that interface. The split
   is: fronts keep their existing rendering (now reachable via
   `front_source: "grid"`); jets/troughs/lines render as simple
   `<path>` elements with CSS classes in the new layer. A user can
   use both layers in the same view for a combined display.

7. **Edge-row grid spacing mirrors the nearest interior.** The
   upstream `dx(j,i)`/`dy(j,i)` convention is the distance between
   `(j, i-1)` and `(j, i+1)`. At `i=0` and `i=nx-1` that would
   require out-of-grid samples. I use the same value as the nearest
   interior row. This keeps `dx`/`dy` well-defined everywhere and is
   accurate to first order at the boundary. An alternative is to
   throw at the boundary, but that would make detection fail for
   any grid that is not artificially padded.

8. **Smoothing / threshold overrides via JSON, not layer-level
   metaparameters.** `ComputedFields` uses a `"tfp"` block on the
   isoband layer to scope TFP options; I put detection options
   directly in each `objects[]` entry of `weather_objects`. This
   keeps the layer's schema flat and gives each object independent
   tuning.

## Follow-up additions (2026-04-18 afternoon)

Added C ABI + C++ wrappers for the four detectors that were deferred
at hand-off, plus a jet-axis variant:

- **`detectJetAxesFFThres`** — `jetaxis_ff_thres` variant with the
  fixed 30 m/s wind-speed mask. Exposed via a new `variant` argument
  on `dynlib_detect_jet_axes`; C++ has both `detectJetAxes` (default)
  and `detectJetAxesFFThres`.
- **`detectRossbyWaveBreakingGradRev`** — wraps `rwb_by_grad_rev`.
  Returns a `RwbResult` struct with all seven per-cell fields
  (anticyc/cyc flag + |grad| + |dPV/dy| + tested mask) as
  `Fmi::Matrix<double>`. Takes a user mask; passes `nullptr` to test
  everywhere.
- **`detectCyclonesByContour`** — wraps `cyclone_by_contour_fortran`.
  The C++ side does the required MSL sort + (i, j) unpacking; caller
  just supplies MSL, orography, lon/lat. Cyclone meta saved/restored
  around the call so a previous call's overrides cannot leak state.
- **`detectPrecipitationBlobs`** — wraps `blobs_fortran`. Same sort
  protocol with a sign flip (upstream triggers on `val < 0`). Returns
  a `BlobResult` with mask + metadata, precip values restored to
  positive sign on output.

Six new unit tests added. All 17 tests pass.

**One gotcha, still unresolved:**
`frontline_at_maxgrad` + the upstream `line_locate` subroutine declare
their output buffers as `intent(out)` but only write the valid prefix.
Under gfortran -O2 the shim's pre-call NaN fill can be elided as a
dead store, so unused slots carry stack leftovers from neighbouring
frames. With the small original test binary this never surfaced; with
more test cases the stack layout shifts and the front detector started
returning 0 lines for inputs that should return 78. The Makefile now
compiles the vendored Fortran with `-O0 -g` to keep output
deterministic. A proper fix would be (a) refactoring the shim to not
rely on `intent(out)` pre-fill semantics, (b) patching upstream
`line_locate` to declare its buffers `intent(inout)`, or (c) porting
the numerics to C++ as originally considered.

## Post-mortem: on-the-fly front detection is not chart-quality

Written 2026-04-18 evening after a day validating the newly wired
detectors against a real ECMWF forecast (`europe_pressurelevels_12utc.sqd`,
three consecutive 12 UTC noons, ~0.25° rotated lat/lon) and the FMI
meteorologist analysis `2026041812_eu_analyysi_fi.png`.

### What we tried

1. **Dry potential temperature θ at 850 hPa** as the scalar input to
   `detectFrontsMaxGrad`. 57–80 front lines per timestep on the
   European domain, visibly far noisier than the analysis chart.
2. **Smoothing passes 3 → 8 and positive `|∇θ|` intensity threshold
   of 1.5e-5 K/m** to filter weak gradient zones (upstream defaults
   are tuned for ERA-Interim's ~1.5° grid and are too permissive at
   0.25°). Line count dropped to ~20–35 per timestep but the curves
   stayed wriggly.
3. **Bolton (1980) θe derived from T + RH** (the stored
   `PseudoAdiabaticPotentialTemperature` field in the test file is
   100 % NaN). θe has sharper frontal gradients, so line positions
   shifted and a few Mediterranean moisture-driven frontal zones that
   θ missed came through. Overall shape and noise character were
   unchanged.

### What did not work and why

None of the tuning steps produced output qualitatively comparable to
the forecaster chart. The gap is structural, not a parameter-tuning
problem:

- **Definition mismatch.** A meteorologist integrates 4–6 fields
  (θe, SLP, wind, satellite imagery, the previous chart) plus
  continuity reasoning and draws a single smooth curve per front.
  `detectFrontsMaxGrad` finds zero crossings of ∇²(field) on the
  grid — per-cell discretisation of a second derivative, guaranteed
  to be noisy.
- **No temporal continuity.** The upstream detector has no tracking
  or persistence filter. A real forecaster carries the previous
  chart forward; the algorithm sees each timestep in isolation.
- **Fronts are a forecaster convention.** Unlike jet axes (defined
  by zero shear), blocking (gradient reversal), cyclones (closed
  contours), and troughs (relative vorticity maxima) — which have
  objective physical criteria — a "front" is partly what the
  forecaster says it is. No algorithm will perfectly reproduce a
  chart built on partly-subjective criteria.
- **Independent evidence.** Every automatic frontal-analysis product
  surveyed on the web has the same character: either noisier than a
  hand-drawn chart (classical algorithms like dynlib, DWD Hewson,
  Parfitt F) or requires ML (Biard & Kunkel 2019, Niebler 2022,
  Justin 2023) trained on thousands of labelled charts. The research
  consensus since ~2019 is that ML is the direction forward for
  chart-quality front detection.

### Decision

On-the-fly computed fronts are **not advertised** as a SmartMet
Server feature. The library keeps the front-detection entry points
because they are useful as inputs to downstream physical diagnostics
(conveyor belts, frontogenesis rate, moisture transport along baroclinic
zones) and for research workflows where gradient-based detection is
an acceptable proxy. Chart-quality fronts should come from:

1. A precomputed external product (database-backed or file-backed),
   produced either by an ML model or by a tuned classical pipeline
   with post-processing (line stitching, length filtering, temporal
   persistence). Served as gridded data or line features via the
   normal SmartMet product path.
2. Not a per-request calculation. Fronts change on synoptic
   timescales (hours), not query timescales.

The `FrontSource` abstraction in the WMS plugin remains a reasonable
extension point — add a `DatabaseFrontSource` or
`PrecomputedFrontSource` next to the existing `GridFrontSource`.

### What survives

The other detectors remain in scope for on-the-fly serving via the
WMS plugin:

- **Jet axes** (`detectJetAxes`, `detectJetAxesFFThres`) — zero-shear
  lines, unambiguous physical definition.
- **Blocking indicator** — a scalar field handed to the existing
  isoband renderer.
- **Trough axes** (vorticity-line alias) — cyclonic-vorticity maxima.
- **Convergence / deformation lines** — well-defined wind diagnostics.
- **Cyclone detection** — closed-contour SLP minima with area filter.
- **RWB gradient reversal** — grid-cell flags, renders as a heatmap.
- **Precipitation blobs** — closed-contour precipitation maxima.

These all produce output that is meaningful directly, without needing
to match a forecaster's subjective line work.

## Deferred
- **Caching.** Each `WeatherObjectsLayer::generate` re-fetches grid
  data and re-runs detection every render. For animations this is
  probably prohibitively slow. Consider a `Fmi::Cache::Cache` keyed
  on `(producer, time, object_spec_hash)`.
- **Coordinate system edge cases.** The current grid-index → lon/lat
  conversion is bilinear on the coordinate matrix. Fine for
  continuous grids, unsafe across the antimeridian or across polar
  singularities. If you expose this for global products,
  `gis::Interrupt` handling is needed.
- **Grid-engine backend.** I only wired the querydata engine. The
  grid engine (`Engine::Grid`) uses a different API. An analogous
  data-fetch path is needed if dynlib should work against
  GRIB/NetCDF-backed producers. The `GridFrontSource` + layer
  factoring makes this easy to add without touching the C++/Fortran
  boundary.
- **SVG styling.** The `weather_objects` layer emits
  `<path class="jet-axis"/>` etc. with no arrow heads or direction
  decoration. Jets typically get an arrowhead at the downstream end.
  This is SVG work; no detection changes needed.
- **ECMWF / ERA5 tuning.** Upstream thresholds (`frint_thres =
  -2e-11`, `frspd_thres = 1.5 m/s`, `nsmooth = 2`) were tuned for
  ERA-Interim. Harmonie/MEPS will probably need different values.
  The JSON schema already exposes the overrides.

## Alternatives I did not take (listed for discussion)

- **Reimplement the numerics in C++ instead of linking Fortran.** I
  chose the link route because the audit showed kernels are clean
  (no netCDF / no Python coupling at the Fortran level) and MIT-
  licensed, so link is cheaper than a port. A pure-C++ port is still
  attractive if you want SmartMet to control the algorithm code path
  and avoid the gfortran dependency. Cost: weeks.
- **Embed CPython and call dynlib as a Python library.** Fastest to
  prototype but unsuitable for a long-running multi-threaded plugin
  (GIL, interpreter lifetime, NumPy in the closed tree). Rejected.
- **One unified layer that also handles blocking / cyclone masks.**
  Would require merging line-feature rendering with isoband-style
  contouring of a scalar field in the same layer. Probably better as
  a dedicated `blocking` object that emits computed fields consumable
  by the existing `IsobandLayer` — more work but cleaner separation.
  Deferred.
- **Migrate `WeatherFrontsLayer` and `ComputedFields::computeTFP` to
  `Fmi::Matrix<double>` too.** Consistent, avoids the
  `NFmiDataMatrix<float>` per-row allocations inside the plugin.
  Non-trivial touch across IsobandLayer/IsolineLayer. Deferred.

## How to validate in the morning

```bash
# 1. Library
cd ~/hub/smartmet-library-dynlib
